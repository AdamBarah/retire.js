Known issues:
* Hitting the back button does not update the toolbar button badge.
* When two Firefox windows are open the toolbar button badge is updated in both windows.   
* On some browser profiles the button is not moved to the toolbar after install.
  Workaround: Manually move it the toolbar
  
  
Todo:
 * Simplify main.js - setBadgeCount: Add tabId argument and only update badge if the id is the active tab id
