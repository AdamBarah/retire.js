Known issues:
* On some browser profiles the button is not moved to the toolbar after install.
  Workaround: Manually move it the toolbar
  
Todo:
 * Try caching the log messages so they are not lost when the console's limit (200) is reached.
   * The jsSources should be converted to an object.
 * Update info package.json
 * Simplify main.js - setBadgeCount: Add tabId argument and only update badge if the id is the active tab id
